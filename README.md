# Investigating Air Quality Factors and Their Impact on Human Health

This project explores how human activities, meteorological factors, and sensor accuracy affect air pollutant levels in an Italian city. Using statistical modeling, visualization, and hypothesis testing, we examine CO, NOx, Benzene, and O₃ patterns from 9,000+ sensor readings.

## Project Structure

- `data/` – Raw and cleaned data files
- `pythoncode.ipynb` – Python Jupyter notebooks with EDA and modeling
- `figures/` – Final plots and heatmaps used in the report
- `Report` – Final LaTeX PDF report
- `Presentation` – Slide deck
- `README.md` – Project overview

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- LaTeX (for report generation)
- Marp (for presentation)

## Key Findings

- Rush hour traffic leads to significant spikes in CO and NOx levels.
- Winter months show elevated pollution due to weather-induced trapping.
- One NOx sensor showed anomalous behavior (strong negative correlation).
- Humidity and temperature effects were weaker than expected.
